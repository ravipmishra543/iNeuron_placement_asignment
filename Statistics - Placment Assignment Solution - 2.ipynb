    "a. To determine the percentage of individuals in the dataset with heights between 160 cm and 180 cm, we need to calculate the z-scores corresponding to these heights and find the area under the normal distribution curve between those z-scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's calculate the z-scores:\n",
    "For 160 cm:\n",
    "z = (160 - mean) / standard deviation = (160 - 170) / 10 = -1\n",
    "\n",
    "For 180 cm:\n",
    "z = (180 - mean) / standard deviation = (180 - 170) / 10 = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we need to find the area under the normal distribution curve between -1 and 1. We can use a standard normal distribution table or a statistical software to find this value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The area between -1 and 1 under the standard normal distribution curve is approximately 0.6826, which means that approximately 68.26% of individuals in the dataset have heights between 160 cm and 180 cm.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. To find the probability that the average height of 100 randomly selected individuals from the dataset is greater than 175 cm, we can use the Central Limit Theorem. According to the theorem, when the sample size is large enough, the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution with the same mean as the population and a standard deviation equal to the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the population mean is 170 cm, the population standard deviation is 10 cm, and the sample size is 100. So, the standard deviation of the sample mean is 10 / √100 = 1 cm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can calculate the z-score for a sample mean of 175 cm:\n",
    "z = (175 - mean) / (standard deviation / √sample size) = (175 - 170) / (1 / √100) = 5\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the probability that the sample mean is greater than 175 cm, we can look up the area to the right of the z-score of 5 in the standard normal distribution table or use a statistical software. The probability is very close to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. To calculate the z-score corresponding to a height of 185 cm, we can use the formula:\n",
    "z = (x - mean) / standard deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "Substituting the values, we get:\n",
    "z = (185 - 170) / 10 = 1.5\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the z-score corresponding to a height of 185 cm is 1.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "d. To find the approximate height corresponding to the threshold where 5% of the dataset has heights below that value, we need to find the z-score that corresponds to a cumulative probability of 0.05.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the standard normal distribution table or a statistical software, we can find the z-score that corresponds to a cumulative probability of 0.05, which is approximately -1.645.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can calculate the height using the formula:\n",
    "x = mean + (z * standard deviation)\n",
    "x = 170 + (-1.645 * 10) = 153.55\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the approximate height corresponding to the threshold where 5% of the dataset has heights below that value is approximately 153.55 cm.\n",
    "\n",
    "e. The coefficient of variation (CV) is a measure of relative variability and is calculated as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean, expressed as a percentage.\n",
    "\n",
    "CV = (standard deviation / mean) * 100\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the standard deviation is 10 cm, and the mean is 170 cm.\n",
    "\n",
    "CV = (10 / 170) * 100 = 5.88%\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the coefficient of variation for the dataset is approximately 5.88%.\n",
    "\n",
    "f. Skewness measures the asymmetry of a distribution. If the skewness is zero, it indicates that the dataset is approximately symmetrically distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the skewness is stated to be approximately zero, suggesting that the dataset is approximately normally distributed and symmetric around the mean. This means that the heights are distributed fairly evenly around the mean height of 170 cm, without any significant skew to the left or right.\n",
